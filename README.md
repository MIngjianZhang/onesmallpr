🚀 ONESMALLPR
"One small step for a coder, one giant leap for the AI Empire."

ONESMALLPR is an AI-powered educational platform designed to bridge the gap between "learning to code" and "contributing to open source." Inspired by Neil Armstrong’s first step on the moon, this project empowers beginners to overcome the intimidation of GitHub and make their first meaningful contribution (Good First Issue).

🌓 The Vision
For many beginners, GitHub is a vast, intimidating universe. While AI tools like Cursor and Trae make coding easier, the process of open-source collaboration remains a high hurdle. ONESMALLPR provides the "Lunar Module"—the scaffolding, guidance, and confidence needed to land your first Pull Request and begin building your personal knowledge empire.

✨ Key Features
🛠️ Phase 1: The Scaffolding (Onboarding)
Environment Check: Guided onboarding to ensure you have the basics (GitHub account, Git installed, AI-native IDEs like Trae/Cursor ready).

Tech Profiling: A self-assessment tool to define your current "Tech Empire" boundaries (e.g., Python basics, HTML/CSS).

🔍 Phase 2: Discovery & Triage
Smart Recommendation: Integration with goodfirstissues.com to find tasks that match your specific skill level.

Smart Deterrence (The Gatekeeper): AI-driven Q&A to ensure you actually understand the Issue before you start coding. No more blind copy-pasting.

📄 Phase 3: The Task Protocol (Artifact Generation)
ONESMALLPR_TASK_PROTOCOL.md: Our core output. A structured Markdown file that acts as a "battle plan" for your local AI IDE (Cursor/Trae/Windsurf).

Bridge the Gap: The protocol defines the macro-context, target logic, and "safety constraints" to ensure your PR is professional and mergeable.

📈 Phase 4: Growth & Evolution
Personal Knowledge Graph: Automatically map the concepts you've mastered (e.g., JSON, CLI, REST APIs) based on your successful PRs.

Continuous Learning: Receive recommendations for "The Next Step" based on your evolving expertise.

💻 Tech Stack
IDE: Trae (AI-native evolution)

LLM API: Volcano Engine (Doubao) / DeepSeek V3

Frontend: React / Next.js

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Deployment: Vercel

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: v18.x or higher.

GitHub Token: Generate a Personal Access Token for API access.

Trae/Cursor: An AI-native IDE is highly recommended for the local execution phase.

📜 The ONESMALLPR Protocol
When you use our platform, you generate a ONESMALLPR_TASK_PROTOCOL.md. This is the secret sauce.

Download the generated .md file.

Move it to the root of the target repository you are contributing to.

Attach it to your AI IDE Chat (Cursor/Trae) and say: "Follow this protocol to guide me through the fix."

🗺️ Roadmap
[ ] MVP: Automated Issue analysis and Protocol generation.

[ ] V1.0: User login with GitHub and "Achievement Badges."

[ ] V2.0: Multimodal support (upload error screenshots, voice-guided PR instructions).

[ ] V3.0: Dynamic 3D Knowledge Graph visualization.
